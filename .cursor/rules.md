## Template neutrality
- This repo is a starter template. Do not add demo routes/pages (e.g. /health, /notes), sample data, or example features unless explicitly requested.
- Keep `src/app` minimal (only what is required by Next.js scaffolding).

## Command execution (Cursor agent)
- If a dev server is already running, reuse it (do not start another instance).
